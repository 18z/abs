第四章第一節：變數替換

The name of a variable is a placeholder for its value, the data it holds. 

>`變數名稱就是本身的值或資料的佔位符號。`

Referencing (retrieving) its value is called variable substitution.

>`提取該變數即稱變數替換。`

Let us carefully distinguish between the name of a variable and its value. 

>`接下來我們仔細探討變數名稱及變數值。`

If variable1 is the name of a variable, then $variable1 is a reference to its value, the data item it contains. [1]

>`假如 variable1 就是變數名，則 $variable1 就是直指variable1 所儲存的值。`

        bash$ variable1=23


        bash$ echo variable1
        variable1

        bash$ echo $variable1
        23
        
The only times a variable appears "naked" -- without the $ prefix	-- is when declared or assigned, when unset, when exported, in an arithmetic expression within double parentheses (( ... )), or in the special case of a variable representing a signal (see Example 32-5). 

>`當變數是naked時，也就是前面沒有 $ 時，即是代表 該變數已被宣告、指定值、被unset、被exported、在數值運算時沒有用雙括號或是在範例 32-5中，變數被用來代表「訊號」。`

Assignment may be with an = (as in var1=27), in a read statement, and at the head of a loop (for var2 in 1 2 3).

>`變數值指派一般來說，是當等號出現時，或者是在一個敘述語句中，例如 for 迴圈一開始的地方。`

Enclosing a referenced value in double quotes (" ... ") does not interfere with variable substitution. 

>`若用括弧將變數值 (referenced value) 刮起來，不影響到變數替換。`

This is called partial quoting, sometimes referred to as "weak quoting." Using single quotes (' ... ') causes the variable name to be used literally, and no substitution will take place. This is full quoting, sometimes referred to as 'strong quoting.' See Chapter 5 for a detailed discussion.

Note that $variable is actually a simplified form of ${variable}. In contexts where the $variable syntax causes an error, the longer form may work (see Section 10.2, below).
