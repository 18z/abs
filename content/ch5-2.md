5.2. Escaping
===

*Escaping* is a method of quoting single characters.

The escape (`\\`) preceding a character tells the shell to interpret that character literally.

Note: With certain commands and utilities, such as echo and sed, escaping a character may have the opposite effect - it can toggle on a special meaning for that character.

**Special meanings of certain escaped characters**

used with **echo** and **sed**

`\n` means newline

`\r` means return

`\t` means tab

`\v` means vertical tab

`\b` means backspace

`\a` means *alert* (beep or flash)

`\0xx` translates to the octal ASCII equivalent of `0nn`, where `nn` is a string of digits

Note: The `$' ... '` quoted string-expansion construct is a mechanism that uses escaped octal or hex values to assign ASCII characters to variables, e.g., `quote=$'\042'`.

Example 5-2. Escaped Characters

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# escaped.sh: escaped characters

#############################################################
### First, let's show some basic escaped-character usage. ###
#############################################################

# Escaping a newline.
# ------------------

echo ""

echo "This will print
as two lines."
# This will print
# as two lines.

echo "This will print \
as one line."
# This will print as one line.

echo; echo

echo "============="


echo "\v\v\v\v"      # Prints \v\v\v\v literally.
# Use the -e option with 'echo' to print escaped characters.

echo "============="
echo "VERTICAL TABS"
echo -e "\v\v\v\v"   # Prints 4 vertical tabs.
echo "=============="

echo "QUOTATION MARK"
echo -e "\042"       # Prints " (quote, octal ASCII character 42).
echo "=============="



# The $'\X' construct makes the -e option unnecessary.

echo; echo "NEWLINE and (maybe) BEEP"
echo $'\n'           # Newline.
echo $'\a'           # Alert (beep).
                     # May only flash, not beep, depending on terminal.

# We have seen $'\nnn" string expansion, and now . . .

# =================================================================== #
# Version 2 of Bash introduced the $'\nnn' string expansion construct.
# =================================================================== #

echo "Introducing the \$\' ... \' string-expansion construct . . . "
echo ". . . featuring more quotation marks."

echo $'\t \042 \t'   # Quote (") framed by tabs.
# Note that  '\nnn' is an octal value.

# It also works with hexadecimal values, in an $'\xhhh' construct.
echo $'\t \x22 \t'  # Quote (") framed by tabs.
# Thank you, Greg Keraunen, for pointing this out.
# Earlier Bash versions allowed '\x022'.

echo


# Assigning ASCII characters to a variable.
# ----------------------------------------
quote=$'\042'        # " assigned to a variable.
echo "$quote Quoted string $quote and this lies outside the quotes."

echo

# Concatenating ASCII chars in a variable.
triple_underline=$'\137\137\137'  # 137 is octal ASCII code for '_'.
echo "$triple_underline UNDERLINE $triple_underline"

echo

ABC=$'\101\102\103\010'           # 101, 102, 103 are octal A, B, C.
echo $ABC

echo

escape=$'\033'                    # 033 is octal for escape.
echo "\"escape\" echoes as $escape"
#                                   no visible output.

echo

exit 0

`\"` gives the quote its literal meaning

```bash
echo "Hello"                     # Hello
echo "\"Hello\" ... he said."    # "Hello" ... he said.
```

`\$` gives the dollar sign its literal meaning (variable name following `\$` will not be referenced)

```bash
echo "\$variable01"           # $variable01
echo "The book cost \$7.98."  # The book cost $7.98.
```

`\\` gives the backslash its literal meaning

```bash
echo "\\"  # Results in \

# Whereas . . .

echo "\"   # Invokes secondary prompt from the command-line.
           # In a script, gives an error message.

# However . . .

echo '\'   # Results in \
```

Note: The behavior of `\\` depends on whether it is escaped, *strong-quoted*, *weak-quoted*, or appearing within *command substitution* or a *here document*.

```bash
                      #  Simple escaping and quoting
echo \z               #  z
echo \\z              # \z
echo '\z'             # \z
echo '\\z'            # \\z
echo "\z"             # \z
echo "\\z"            # \z

                      #  Command substitution
echo `echo \z`        #  z
echo `echo \\z`       #  z
echo `echo \\\z`      # \z
echo `echo \\\\z`     # \z
echo `echo \\\\\\z`   # \z
echo `echo \\\\\\\z`  # \\z
echo `echo "\z"`      # \z
echo `echo "\\z"`     # \z

                      # Here document
cat <<EOF
\z
EOF                   # \z

cat <<EOF
\\z
EOF                   # \z

```

Elements of a string assigned to a variable may be escaped, but the escape character alone may not be assigned to a variable.

```bash
variable=\
echo "$variable"
# Will not work - gives an error message:
# test.sh: : command not found
# A "naked" escape cannot safely be assigned to a variable.
#
#  What actually happens here is that the "\" escapes the newline and
#+ the effect is       variable=echo "$variable"
#+                     invalid variable assignment

variable=\
23skidoo
echo "$variable"        #  23skidoo
                        #  This works, since the second line
                        #+ is a valid variable assignment.

variable=\ 
#        \^    escape followed by space
echo "$variable"        # space

variable=\\
echo "$variable"        # \

variable=\\\
echo "$variable"
# Will not work - gives an error message:
# test.sh: \: command not found
#
#  First escape escapes second one, but the third one is left "naked",
#+ with same result as first instance, above.

variable=\\\\
echo "$variable"        # \\
                        # Second and fourth escapes escaped.
                        # This is o.k.
```

Escaping a space can prevent word splitting in a command's argument list.

```bash
file_list="/bin/cat /bin/gzip /bin/more /usr/bin/less /usr/bin/emacs-20.7"
# List of files as argument(s) to a command.

# Add two files to the list, and list all.
ls -l /usr/X11R6/bin/xsetroot /sbin/dump $file_list

echo "-------------------------------------------------------------------------"

# What happens if we escape a couple of spaces?
ls -l /usr/X11R6/bin/xsetroot\ /sbin/dump\ $file_list
# Error: the first three files concatenated into a single argument to 'ls -l'
#        because the two escaped spaces prevent argument (word) splitting.
```

The escape also provides a means of writing a multi-line command.

Normally, each separate line constitutes a different command, but an escape at the end of a line *escapes the newline character*, and the command sequence continues on to the next line.

```bash
(cd /source/directory && tar cf - . ) | \
(cd /dest/directory && tar xpvf -)
# Repeating Alan Cox's directory tree copy command,
# but split into two lines for increased legibility.

# As an alternative:
tar cf - -C /source/directory . |
tar xpvf - -C /dest/directory
# See note below.
# (Thanks, Stéphane Chazelas.)
```

Note: If a script line ends with a |, a pipe character, then a \, an escape, is not strictly necessary.

It is, however, good programming practice to always escape the end of a line of code that continues to the following line.

```bash
echo "foo
bar"
#foo
#bar

echo

echo 'foo
bar'    # No difference yet.
#foo
#bar

echo

echo foo\
bar     # Newline escaped.
#foobar

echo

echo "foo\
bar"     # Same here, as \ still interpreted as escape within weak quotes.
#foobar

echo

echo 'foo\
bar'     # Escape character \ taken literally because of strong quoting.
#foo\
#bar

# Examples suggested by Stéphane Chazelas.
```
