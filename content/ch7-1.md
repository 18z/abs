7.1. Test Constructs

第七章 第一節 測試結構
---

An if/then construct tests whether the exit status of a list of commands is 0 (since 0 means "success" by UNIX convention), and if so, executes one or more commands.

>`if/then 結構可判斷測試條件狀態，若狀態為 0 (在 UNIX 中，0 表示成功的意思) 則表示符合測試條件，並執行一個或多個指令。`

There exists a dedicated command called [ (left bracket special character). 
>`[ (左中括號為特殊字元) 為一專用指令。`

It is a synonym for test, and a builtin for efficiency reasons. This command considers its arguments as comparison expressions or file tests and returns an exit status corresponding to the result of the comparison (0 for true, 1 for false).

With version 2.02, Bash introduced the [[ ... ]] extended test command, which performs comparisons in a manner more familiar to programmers from other languages. Note that [[ is a keyword, not a command.

Bash sees [[ $a -lt $b ]] as a single element, which returns an exit status.


The (( ... )) and let ... constructs return an exit status, according to whether the arithmetic expressions they evaluate expand to a non-zero value. These arithmetic-expansion constructs may therefore be used to perform arithmetic comparisons.

```bash
(( 0 && 1 ))                 # Logical AND
echo $?     # 1     ***
# And so ...
let "num = (( 0 && 1 ))"
echo $num   # 0
# But ...
let "num = (( 0 && 1 ))"
echo $?     # 1     ***


(( 200 || 11 ))              # Logical OR
echo $?     # 0     ***
# ...
let "num = (( 200 || 11 ))"
echo $num   # 1
let "num = (( 200 || 11 ))"
echo $?     # 0     ***


(( 200 | 11 ))               # Bitwise OR
echo $?                      # 0     ***
# ...
let "num = (( 200 | 11 ))"
echo $num                    # 203
let "num = (( 200 | 11 ))"
echo $?                      # 0     ***

# The "let" construct returns the same exit status
#+ as the double-parentheses arithmetic expansion.
```
