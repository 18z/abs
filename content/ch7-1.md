7.1. Test Constructs

第七章 第一節 測試結構
---

An if/then construct tests whether the exit status of a list of commands is 0 (since 0 means "success" by UNIX convention), and if so, executes one or more commands.

>`if/then 結構可判斷測試條件狀態，若狀態為 0 (在 UNIX 中，0 表示成功的意思) 則表示符合測試條件，並執行一個或多個指令。`

There exists a dedicated command called [ (left bracket special character). 
>`[ (左中括號為特殊字元) 為一專用指令。`

It is a synonym for test, and a builtin for efficiency reasons. 
>`它是測試的代名詞。另外，考量到效能，它也同時是內建的 (builtin)。`

This command considers its arguments as comparison expressions or file tests and returns an exit status corresponding to the result of the comparison (0 for true, 1 for false).
>`該指令將「比較表示式」(comparison expressions) 或檔案測試當作是參數，並在退出狀態中顯示比較或測試的結果。(0 表示 true，1 表示 false)`

With version 2.02, Bash introduced the [[ ... ]] extended test command, which performs comparisons in a manner more familiar to programmers from other languages. 
>`Bash 2.02 版新增了 [[ ... ]] 測試指令，此測試指令寫法，讓熟悉其他程式語言的開發者更感到親切。`

Note that [[ is a keyword, not a command.
>`注意，[[ 是關鍵字 (keyword)，非指令。`

Bash sees [[ $a -lt $b ]] as a single element, which returns an exit status.


The (( ... )) and let ... constructs return an exit status, according to whether the arithmetic expressions they evaluate expand to a non-zero value. These arithmetic-expansion constructs may therefore be used to perform arithmetic comparisons.

```bash
(( 0 && 1 ))                 # Logical AND
echo $?     # 1     ***
# And so ...
let "num = (( 0 && 1 ))"
echo $num   # 0
# But ...
let "num = (( 0 && 1 ))"
echo $?     # 1     ***


(( 200 || 11 ))              # Logical OR
echo $?     # 0     ***
# ...
let "num = (( 200 || 11 ))"
echo $num   # 1
let "num = (( 200 || 11 ))"
echo $?     # 0     ***


(( 200 | 11 ))               # Bitwise OR
echo $?                      # 0     ***
# ...
let "num = (( 200 | 11 ))"
echo $num                    # 203
let "num = (( 200 | 11 ))"
echo $?                      # 0     ***

# The "let" construct returns the same exit status
#+ as the double-parentheses arithmetic expansion.
```
