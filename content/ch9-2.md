9.2. Typing variables: declare or typeset
>`9.2. 變數型態：宣告與設定`

---

The declare or typeset builtins, which are exact synonyms, permit modifying the properties of variables. 
>`內建的宣告與設定 (兩者為同義詞)，允許修改變數的 properties。`

This is a very weak form of the typing [1] available in certain programming languages. 
>`在特定程式語言中，是相當 weak form 的 typing。`

The declare command is specific to version 2 or later of Bash. 
>`declare 指令是在第二版或更之後版本才有。`

The typeset command also works in ksh scripts.
>`typeset 指令在 ksh 腳本中一樣可用。`

declare/typeset options
>`declare/typeset 參數`

-r readonly
>`-r 只能讀取`

    ```
    (declare -r var1 works the same as readonly var1)
    # declare readonly var1 與 -r var1 功能相同。
    This is the rough equivalent of the C const type qualifier. 
    # 大略與 C 語言中 const type qualifier 相同。
    An attempt to change the value of a readonly variable fails with an error message.
    # 若想改變 readonly 屬性的變數值，會跳錯誤訊息。
    ```
    
    ```bash
    declare -r var1=1
    echo "var1 = $var1"   # var1 = 1

    (( var1++ ))          # x.sh: line 4: var1: readonly variable
                          # x.sh: 第四行: var1: 只有讀取權限的變數
    ```

-i integer

    ```bash
    declare -i number
    # The script will treat subsequent occurrences of "number" as an integer.	
    # 此腳本會將參數後面的數字視為整數。

    number=3
    echo "Number = $number"     # Number = 3

    number=three
    echo "Number = $number"     # Number = 0
    # Tries to evaluate the string "three" as an integer.
    # 字串 three 會被視為是整數。
    ```

    ```
    Certain arithmetic operations are permitted for declared integer variables without the need for expr or let.
    # 特定的算術運算在宣告時是被允許的，且不需要用到 expr 或 let。
    ```
    
    ```bash
    n=6/3
    echo "n = $n"       # n = 6/3

    declare -i n
    n=6/3
    echo "n = $n"       # n = 2
    ```
    
-a array

    ```bash
    declare -a indices
    ```
    
    ```
    The variable indices will be treated as an array.
    # 此變數將被視為陣列。
    ```
    
-f function(s)

    ```bash
    declare -f
    ```
    
    ```
    A declare -f line with no arguments in a script causes a listing of all the functions previously defined in that script.
    ```
    
    ```bash
    declare -f function_name
    ```
    
    ```
    A declare -f function_name in a script lists just the function named.
    ```
    
-x export

    ```bash
    declare -x var3
    ```
    
    ```
    This declares a variable as available for exporting outside the environment of the script itself.
    ```
    
-x var=$value

    ```bash
    declare -x var3=373
    ```
    
    ```
    The declare command permits assigning a value to a variable in the same statement as setting its properties.
    ```
    
Example 9-10. Using declare to type variables

```bash
#!/bin/bash

func1 ()
{
  echo This is a function.
}

declare -f        # Lists the function above.

echo

declare -i var1   # var1 is an integer.
var1=2367
echo "var1 declared as $var1"
var1=var1+1       # Integer declaration eliminates the need for 'let'.
echo "var1 incremented by 1 is $var1."
# Attempt to change variable declared as integer.
echo "Attempting to change var1 to floating point value, 2367.1."
var1=2367.1       # Results in error message, with no change to variable.
echo "var1 is still $var1"

echo

declare -r var2=13.36         # 'declare' permits setting a variable property
                              #+ and simultaneously assigning it a value.
echo "var2 declared as $var2" # Attempt to change readonly variable.
var2=13.37                    # Generates error message, and exit from script.

echo "var2 is still $var2"    # This line will not execute.

exit 0                        # Script will not exit here.
```

Using the declare builtin restricts the scope of a variable. 

```bash
foo ()
{
FOO="bar"
}

bar ()
{
foo
echo $FOO
}

bar   # Prints bar.
```

However . . . 

```bash
foo (){
declare FOO="bar"
}

bar ()
{
foo
echo $FOO
}

bar  # Prints nothing.
