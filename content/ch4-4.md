4.4. Special Variable Types

第四章第四節：變數的特殊型態
===

*Local variables*

Variables visible only within a code block or function (see also local variables in functions)

*Environmental variables*

Variables that affect the behavior of the shell and user interface

In a more general context, each process has an "environment", that is, a group of variables that the process may reference.

In this sense, the shell behaves like any other process.

Every time a shell starts, it creates shell variables that correspond to its own environmental variables.

Updating or adding new environmental variables causes the shell to update its environment, and all the shell's *child processes* (the commands it executes) inherit this environment.

Note: The space allotted to the environment is limited.

Creating too many environmental variables or ones that use up excessive space may cause problems.

```bash
bash$ eval "`seq 10000 | sed -e 's/.*/export var&=ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ/'`"
bash$ du
bash: /usr/bin/du: Argument list too long
```

Note: this "error" has been fixed, as of kernel version 2.6.23.

(Thank you, Stéphane Chazelas for the clarification, and for providing the above example.)

If a script sets environmental variables, they need to be "exported," that is, reported to the *environment* local to the script.

This is the function of the export command.

A script can **export** variables only to child processes, that is, only to commands or processes which that particular script initiates.

A script invoked from the command-line *cannot* export variables back to the command-line environment.

*Child processes cannot export variables back to the parent processes that spawned them.*

**Definition**: A *child process* is a subprocess launched by another process, its parent.

*Positional parameters*

Arguments passed to the script from the command line [26] : `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, `$3` . . .

`$0` is the name of the script itself, `$1` is the first argument, `$2` the second, `$3` the third, and so forth. [27]

After `$9`, the arguments must be enclosed in brackets, for example, `${10}`, `${11}`, `${12}`.

The special variables `$*` and `$@` denote all the positional parameters.

Example 4-5. Positional Parameters
---

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Call this script with at least 10 parameters, for example
# ./scriptname 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
MINPARAMS=10

echo

echo "The name of this script is \"$0\"."
# Adds ./ for current directory
echo "The name of this script is \"`basename $0`\"."
# Strips out path name info (see 'basename')

echo

if [ -n "$1" ]                 # Tested variable is quoted.
then
  echo "Parameter #1 is $1"    # Need quotes to escape #
fi

if [ -n "$2" ]
then
  echo "Parameter #2 is $2"
fi

if [ -n "$3" ]
then
  echo "Parameter #3 is $3"
fi

# ...


if [ -n "${10}" ]              # Parameters > $9 must be enclosed in {brackets}.
then
  echo "Parameter #10 is ${10}"
fi

echo "-----------------------------------"
echo "All the command-line parameters are: "$*""

if [ $# -lt "$MINPARAMS" ]
then
  echo
  echo "This script needs at least $MINPARAMS command-line arguments!"
fi

echo

exit 0
```

*Bracket notation* for positional parameters leads to a fairly simple way of referencing the *last* argument passed to a script on the command-line.

This also requires indirect referencing.

```bash
args=$#           # Number of args passed.
lastarg=${!args}
# Note: This is an *indirect reference* to $args ...


# Or:       lastarg=${!#}             (Thanks, Chris Monson.)
# This is an *indirect reference* to the $# variable.
# Note that lastarg=${!$#} doesn't work.
```

Some scripts can perform different operations, depending on which name they are invoked with.

For this to work, the script needs to check `$0`, the name it was invoked by. [28]

There must also exist symbolic links to all the alternate names of the script. See Example 16-2.

If a script expects a command-line parameter but is invoked without one, this may cause a null variable assignment, generally an undesirable result.

One way to prevent this is to append an extra character to both sides of the assignment statement using the expected positional parameter.

```bash
variable1_=$1_  # Rather than variable1=$1
# This will prevent an error, even if positional parameter is absent.

critical_argument01=$variable1_

# The extra character can be stripped off later, like so.
variable1=${variable1_/_/}
# Side effects only if $variable1_ begins with an underscore.
# This uses one of the parameter substitution templates discussed later.
# (Leaving out the replacement pattern results in a deletion.)

#  A more straightforward way of dealing with this is
#+ to simply test whether expected positional parameters have been passed.
if [ -z $1 ]
then
  exit $E_MISSING_POS_PARAM
fi

#  However, as Fabian Kreutz points out,
#+ the above method may have unexpected side-effects.
#  A better method is parameter substitution:
#         ${1:-$DefaultVal}
#  See the "Parameter Substition" section
#+ in the "Variables Revisited" chapter.
```

Example 4-6. *wh*, *whois* domain name lookup
---

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ex18.sh

# Does a 'whois domain-name' lookup on any of 3 alternate servers:
#                    ripe.net, cw.net, radb.net

# Place this script -- renamed 'wh' -- in /usr/local/bin

# Requires symbolic links:
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-ripe
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-apnic
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-tucows

E_NOARGS=75


if [ -z "$1" ]
then
echo "Usage: `basename $0` [domain-name]"
  exit $E_NOARGS
fi

# Check script name and call proper server.
case `basename $0` in    # Or:    case ${0##*/} in
    "wh"       ) whois $1@whois.tucows.com;;
    "wh-ripe"  ) whois $1@whois.ripe.net;;
    "wh-apnic" ) whois $1@whois.apnic.net;;
    "wh-cw"    ) whois $1@whois.cw.net;;
    *          ) echo "Usage: `basename $0` [domain-name]";;
esac

exit $?
```

The **shift** command reassigns the positional parameters, in effect shifting them to the left one notch.

`$1` <--- `$2`, `$2` <--- `$3`, `$3` <--- `$4`, etc.

The old `$1` disappears, but `$0` (*the script name*) does not change.

If you use a large number of positional parameters to a script, **shift** lets you access those past `10`, although {bracket} notation also permits this.

Example 4-7. Using *shift*
---

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# shft.sh: Using 'shift' to step through all the positional parameters.

#  Name this script something like shft.sh,
#+ and invoke it with some parameters.
#+ For example:
#             sh shft.sh a b c def 83 barndoor

until [ -z "$1" ]  # Until all parameters used up . . .
do
  echo -n "$1 "
  shift
done

echo               # Extra linefeed.

# But, what happens to the "used-up" parameters?
echo "$2"
#  Nothing echoes!
#  When $2 shifts into $1 (and there is no $3 to shift into $2)
#+ then $2 remains empty.
#  So, it is not a parameter *copy*, but a *move*.

exit

#  See also the echo-params.sh script for a "shiftless"
#+ alternative method of stepping through the positional params.
```

The **shift** command can take a numerical parameter indicating how many positions to shift.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# shift-past.sh

shift 3    # Shift 3 positions.
#  n=3; shift $n
#  Has the same effect.

echo "$1"

exit 0

# ======================== #
```

```bash
$ sh shift-past.sh 1 2 3 4 5
4

#  However, as Eleni Fragkiadaki, points out,
#+ attempting a 'shift' past the number of
#+ positional parameters ($#) returns an exit status of 1,
#+ and the positional parameters themselves do not change.
#  This means possibly getting stuck in an endless loop. . . .
#  For example:
#      until [ -z "$1" ]
#      do
#         echo -n "$1 "
#         shift 20    #  If less than 20 pos params,
#      done           #+ then loop never ends!
#
# When in doubt, add a sanity check. . . .
#           shift 20 || break
#                    ^^^^^^^^
```

The **shift** command works in a similar fashion on parameters passed to a function.

See Example 36-18.
