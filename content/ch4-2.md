第四章第二節：變數值
---

the assignment operator (no space before and after)

>`指定變數值的運算子(運算子前後都不能有空格)`

Caution	
Do not confuse this with = and -eq, which test, rather than assign!

>`注意：這是變數賦值，別跟 test 指令的 = 與 -eq 運算子混淆！`

Note that = can be either an assignment or a test operator, depending on context.

>`請注意 = 可以是一個賦值運算子或一個 test 運算子，依所處的內容而意義有所不同。`

Example 4-2. Plain Variable Assignment

    #!/bin/bash
    # Naked variables

    echo

    # When is a variable "naked", i.e., lacking the '$' in front?
    # When it is being assigned, rather than referenced.

    # Assignment
    a=879
    echo "The value of \"a\" is $a."

    # Assignment using 'let'
    let a=16+5
    echo "The value of \"a\" is now $a."

    echo

    # In a 'for' loop (really, a type of disguised assignment):
    echo -n "Values of \"a\" in the loop are: "
    for a in 7 8 9 11
    do
      echo -n "$a "
    done

    echo
    echo

    # In a 'read' statement (also a type of assignment):
    echo -n "Enter \"a\" "
    read a
    echo "The value of \"a\" is now $a."

    echo

    exit 0

Example 4-3. Variable Assignment, plain and fancy

    #!/bin/bash
    a=23              # Simple case
    echo $a
    b=$a
    echo $b

    # Now, getting a little bit fancier (command substitution).

    a=`echo Hello!`   # Assigns result of 'echo' command to 'a' ...
    echo $a
    # Note that including an exclamation mark (!) within a
    #+ command substitution construct will not work from the command-line,
    #+ since this triggers the Bash "history mechanism."
    # Inside a script, however, the history functions are disabled by default.

    a=`ls -l`         # Assigns result of 'ls -l' command to 'a'
    echo $a           # Unquoted, however, it removes tabs and newlines.
    echo
    echo "$a"         # The quoted variable preserves whitespace.
                      # (See the chapter on "Quoting.")

    exit 0

Variable assignment using the $(...) mechanism (a newer method than backquotes).

This is likewise a form of command substitution.

    # From /etc/rc.d/rc.local
    R=$(cat /etc/redhat-release)
    arch=$(uname -m)
