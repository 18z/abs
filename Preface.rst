This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming, yet progresses rapidly toward an
intermediate/advanced level of instruction . . . all the while sneaking in little nuggets of UNIX® wisdom and
lore. 
本教材涵蓋範圍從初級知識(「無程市設計或腳本相關經驗」的人皆可看懂)，快速前進至中級甚至是高級的水平，並從中帶領讀者淺嚐UNIX®的知識及智慧。


It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and as a reference and source of knowledge on shell
scripting techniques. 
本教材可視為教科書、自學手冊或學習shell scripting技術之參考文獻。

The exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader participation, under
the premise that the only way to really learn scripting is to write scripts.


This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to programming concepts.
